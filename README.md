```{
  "review": "I recently watched Alex Garlands film Ex Machina, who is also known for films such as Sunshine and Annihilation. The premise of the film is a young programmer tasked with determining whether an advanced AI possesses true consciousness, and it explores the interesting philosophical dimensions of artificial intelligence and consciousness. In general Garland is able to build an interesting atmosphere and the cinematography is excellent. However, I found that the movie is a bit too slow in the beginning and the characters are only explored at surface level, which personally left me wanting for a bit more. The issues the movie tackles are also quite simplified, possibly to make the film a bit more digestible, but I personally felt that a few less clich√©s would have improved the film.
